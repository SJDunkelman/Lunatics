### Context

Real people lost a lot of money on Luna, but as opposed to Bernie Madoff who went to jail, Do Kwon has been able to re-launch another Luna 2.0 at the disgust of market observers.

This comes at a time when in the NFT market people are fed up with serial scammers. @Zagabond, the founder of Azuki was found to have scammed multiple times and in his PR he described the rug-pulls as 'learnings'. You also have the perceived exuberance of investors piling into things like Goblintown, paying $100K for an NFT during a recession.



### Overview

A free-mint NFT collection of 2022 (?) pieces to celebrate/commiserate the failings of investors and the bear market.

Styled after newspaper cartoons that simply but effectively portray an idea with basic illustrated artwork and a caption.

Users go to lunatics.wtf and go through a process of answering a few questions about the story they want to share. Based on their decisions the artwork is generated, along with a caption underneath (also generated) and minted on Solana.



### NFT System

Only 4 layers to the pieces:

- Background
- Character
- Context
- Caption

Only the background and characters are created by an external artist. The context layer are things added on top of the background to make it specific to the users story - for example a blank billboard in the background has content added to it like a graph of X coin going down.
